## Laravel Specific Config

To publish the config:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=yodlee-config
```

## Local Development

- Ensure a private key named private.pem is stored in the root directory of the application.

Security Warning
================

Storing a private key in public source code repository is a huge security risk.
Ensure the `.gitignore` file contains at least the following:

```
*.pem
*.example.json
*.cache.json
```

The `*.json` ignores are there because some Laravel Artisan commands have the ability to cache and those files should also be ignored.

Commands
========

Numerous Laravel Artisan commands have the ability to cache API requests.

Note: This is a security risk if your .gitignore is not setup correctly. See the section `Security Warning`

https://av.developer.yodlee.com/#c8fbfce3-bc51-4aeb-a795-301086b918d4

First Steps
-----------
You need "/fastlink.php" to set up the link with the bank.

Workflow
--------

This is a basic overview of all the various security layers and workflow before provider data retrieval:

- First log in using the cobrand details. This is cobrand_name, cobrand_login, and cobrand_password
  - These credentials are stored in the .env file

- Then you create cobrand session

- Then you create an API key in the cobrand session & also crease private key and public key using PHP security libraries included

- Then with the API you can create a JWT token - Yodlees supplies a PHP script where you pass API key and private key and then it happens

- Then with the JWT token;

- Then register user call user xyz API call user register - using POSTMAN once you have a user

- Then put all parameters which is the API key and private key

- Put that into sample app

- Type in Username xyz into, clicked go

- Then went into Fastlink - a modal popped up

- In Fastlink modal, there was no accounts

- Then clicked linked Account

- Then choose A provider's name, log in, click link.

Instructions
------------

To start off run initialize_app.php

This will provide you with variables required for the test phases
